# Project Title and Description

PawPediaAPI

This project, initiated on 24th October 2024, is focused on learning how to professionally develop an API. It is my first project of this kind, where the primary goal is to design and implement a backend API using Express.js and PostgreSQL. Through this project, I aim to solidify my understanding of backend development, database integration, and best practices in API design and structure.
